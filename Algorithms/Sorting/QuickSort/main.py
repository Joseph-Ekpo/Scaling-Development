# Pseudocode
# Select a "pivot" element - We'll arbitrarily choose the last element in the list
# Move through all the elements in the list and swap them around until all the numbers less than the pivot are on the left, 
# and the numbers greater than the pivot are on the right

# Move the pivot between the two sections where it belongs
# Recursively repeat for both sections
